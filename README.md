<h1>The Marine Ecosystem Reliance on Water Quality</h1> 
https://tinyurl.com/hack4space-water-quality-2021 \
In this project we decided to use datasets provided by NASA and use some machine learning techniques to understand and predict the volatility of water quality in the coming years from 1960. We programmed this project with the 'R' Scripting language, and used IBM's very own LINUXONE machines for optimized performance. We outlined our problem statement and potential solutions politicans and people alike can start combatting pollution within our water systems. 

**Thanks to everyone who worked on this project with me, it was fun working on a Hackathon online.**
